At first it is useful to find appropriate video course.
You can review a list of online courses at
[Class Central. Android Development](https://www.classcentral.com/subject/android-development)

I choosed some Google courses:
   01. [Android Basics: User Interface](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834)<br/>
       The course may seem too simple. However, do not rush to move on to more advanced courses.
       Try to understand the basic concepts and vocabulary slang used in the development of Android (lessons 1, 2).
       Install Android Studio (lesson 3), create your first project for Android Studio IDE and make some basics GUI.
       The source code with examples is in the [01.basics_-_user_interface](01.basics_-_user_interface) directory.
