### Detect objects with TensorFlow Object Detection API.
The [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct,
train and deploy **object detection** models.

There are 2 main components:
   01. [model training script](object_detection_demo/01_training_script) - 
       Google Colab `*.ipynb` script to train an object detection model.
   02. [mobile app](object_detection_demo/02_mobile_app) -
       a mobile application that uses a trained model in Android.
