### Detect objects with TensorFlow Object Detection API.
The [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct,
train and deploy **object detection** models.

There are 2 main components:
   01. [model training script](01_training_script) - 
       Google Colab `*.ipynb` script to train an object detection model.
   02. [mobile app](02_mobile_app) -
       a mobile application that uses a trained model in Android.

[Take existing]() or [train your own]() model using training scripts.
Save your model to the Google Drive.
Get downloadable direct link using direct link generator for
[Google Drive](https://www.wonderplugin.com/online-tools/google-drive-direct-link-generator),
[Dropbox or Onedrive](https://syncwithtech.blogspot.com/p/direct-download-link-generator.html).
Replace link in the mobile app `???` file on your link.
Run mobile app in Android Studio and enjoy!
