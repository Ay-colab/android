Google Colab `*.ipynb` scripts to use
[TensorFlow object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
   * [`demo_1.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OkqFXb1GSxi7oNkiGfGttSmhaob4ivFy)
     uses existing pre-trained model from the
     [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).
   * [`demo_2.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sKb5rXrwiJTxzk0jZxAmpfIYUg0gj4Bw)
     describes the process of creating your own dataset and training (transfer learning) a new model
     using Google Drive. Must have around **1.5 Gb** of free space on your Google Drive.
   * [`demo_3.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pdc3K4wjmSjQM6SEc0YeI_X7TK7KoDfO)
     creates and trains (transfer learning) a new model totally inside Google Colab.
   * [`demo_4.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zP61kpYJJLxvFfpVkZsv65Cbx0TZ1CM_)
     works with user's dataset.
